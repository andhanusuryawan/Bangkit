Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.\n3. Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.\n4. Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.\n5. For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.\n6. Bonide® Sulfur Plant Fungicide, a finely ground wettable powder, is used in pre-blossom applications and must go on before rainy or spore discharge periods. Apply from pre-pink through cover (2 Tbsp/ gallon of water), or use in cover sprays up to the day of harvest.\n7. Organocide® Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a soil drench or foliar spray (3-4 tsp/ gallon of water) to prevent and attack fungal problems.\n8. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide® Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots."

In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n7. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide® Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water.

New growth tends to be very susceptible to powdery mildew development.\n3. Put plants where they will get enough light and avoid overly shady locations.\n4. Make sure the soil can drain properly. Inadequate drainage can make soil a breeding ground for disease-causing organisms.\n5. Use compost to boost the nutrient levels in the soil, which will in turn increase beneficial microorganism populations.\n6. Keep plants properly maintained by removing any dead or diseased foliage and stems.\n7. Use preventative treatment options, like a Safer® Brand Garden Fungicide, before powdery mildew even forms."

            "1. Resistant varieties: In places where leaf spot occur, these crops can ultimately grow and still be resistant to the disease. Susceptible varieties should not be planted in previously infected areas.\n2. Crop rotation: The amount of initial inoculum will be reduced when a crop other than corn is planted for ≥2 years in that given area; meanwhile proper tillage methods are carried out. Clean plowing and 1-year crop rotation in the absence of corn allows for greater reductions of the disease as well. Note that conventional tilling can reduce disease but can lead to greater soil erosion.\n3. Residue management: Burying the debris under the last year’s crop will help in reducing the presence of Cercospera zeae-maydis, as the fungal-infected debris can only survive above the soil surface. Again this technique will aid in reducing the primary inoculum, but it will not completely eradicate the disease.\n4. Fungicides: Fungicides, if sprayed early in season before initial damage, can be effective in reducing disease. Currently there are 5 known fungicides that treat Corn grey leaf spot.\n5. Planting Date: The impact of GLS is more severe if plants are affected early in their development. Early planting can help reduce yield losses by ensuring the crop is at a later stage of grain fill when conditions are typically favorable for GLS development.\n6. Weed control: By removing weeds, above ground airflow to the crop is increased, relative humidity is decreased, and it limits infection at the most susceptible times."

In either case, no sweet corn is completely resistant.\n2. If the corn begins to show symptoms of infection, immediately spray with a fungicide. The fungicide is most effective when started at the first sign of infection. Two applications may be necessary.\n3. Contact your local extension office for advice regarding specific fungicides and their uses."

            "1. Control of this disease is often focused on management and prevention. First, choose corn varieties or hybrids that are resistant or at least have moderate resistance to northern corn leaf blight.\n2. When you grow corn, make sure it does not stay wet for long periods of time. The fungus that causes this infection needs between six and 18 hours of leaf wetness to develop. Plant corn with enough space for airflow and water in the morning so leaves can dry throughout the day.\n3. The fungus overwinters in plant material, so it is also important to manage infected plants. Tilling the corn into the soil is one strategy, but with a small garden it may make more sense to just remove and destroy the affected plants.\n4. Treating northern corn leaf blight involves using fungicides. For most home gardeners this step isn’t needed, but if you have a bad infection, you may want to try this chemical treatment. The infection usually begins around the time of silking, and this is when the fungicide should be applied."

Raisins affected by measles will be discarded during harvest or at the packing house, while table grape growers will leave affected fruit on the vine.\n2. Current research is focused on protecting pruning wounds from fungal infections to minimize suspect fungi from colonizing fresh wounds."
